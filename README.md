# Devlog Entry - [11/18/2023]

## Introducing the team

- Sean is the tools lead, choosing all the tools we will be using, and making sure that everyone is using those same tools, and is up to date on those tools.
- Miles is the design lead, taking the responsibility of game direction and feel. The initial plan is an ascii art game.
- Cameron is Engine Lead, focusing on overall code structure and implementing - features
- Calex will take the role of Production Lead, ensuring that people are organized and know their deadlines and tasks, keeping us on track to meet targets, and turning in assignments

## Tools and materials

With about one paragraph each...

Tell us about what engines, libraries, frameworks, and or platforms you intend to use, and give us a tiny bit of detail about why your team chose those.

- We plan on starting the project using raw Typescript and HTML, and possibly moving to phaser if we need more of an engine library. We were thinking we could make a cool ASCII art game akin to Universal Paper Clips, and to do so we wouldn’t need any heavy duty graphics libraries. We plan to pivot to Phaser if our design direction changes down the road. We chose to work in Typescript because it is a language we have grown accustomed to over the quarter and will be easy to port to Phaser if need be.

Tell us programming languages (e.g. TypeScript) and data languages (e.g. JSON) your team expects to use and why you chose them. Presumably you’ll just be using the languages expected by your previously chosen engine/platform.

- We plan on using TypeScript and JSON, we chose them because we plan on making a very basic game with ASCII art and buttons, and we feel TypeScript suits these ideals for our design very well.

Tell us about which tools you expect to use in the process of authoring your project. You might name the IDE for writing code, the image editor for creating visual assets, or the 3D editor you will use for building your scene. Again, briefly tell us why you made these choices. Maybe one of your teammates feels especially skilled in that tool or it represents something you all want to learn about.

- We plan to use VSCode for all of our coding, and for source control purposes, we plan on using git. We will use both of these because we are extremely familiar with both of them, and we will feel most comfortable using them. For our visual assets, we plan on just using ASCII art, with text and buttons being implemented directly from HTML and TypeScript files. We chose to do this because we like the idea of making an ASCII art game.

## Outlook

Give us a short section on your outlook on the project. You might cover one or more of these topics:

What is your team hoping to accomplish that other teams might not attempt?

- We think it would be fun to integrate an irrigation system, where players can place sprinklers and potentially even route rivers through their farm

What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?

- Keeping all the data both for garden creation and management sorted and operated on cleanly could end up being a hassle. It doesn’t sound that bad, but sometimes these things can be surprising. The irrigation system mentioned above, although fun, might end up being relatively challenging, as it introduces a number of things to consider.

What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above?

- We’re hoping to learn how to make an ASCII game without the use of any engines. We think it would be cool to be able to make a game that’s just pure TypeScript, and either make everything we need ourselves, or repurposing something for a different use to make our game more interesting as a whole.
